Serialization helps in the process of translating a data structure or object state into a format that can be stored (for example, in a file or memory data buffer) or transmitted (for example, across a computer network) and reconstructed later (possibly in a different computer environment).

Created a C++ library of Trie Data Structure which can do the following tasks\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Make a trie data structure with the help of a list of words or make an entirely empty trie.
\item Inserting all the words into the trie.
\item Converting the trie into a list of words.
\item Find out how many words in the trie that we made before have a given prefix
\item For all the words in the text file given , see if the word is present in the trie
\item Serialize the trie, that is, to convert the trie to a string .
\item Finally ,Create a trie by making the use of a string representing the trie(\+Deserialization)
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Note\+: Serialization of the trie to a string makes use of special characters \textquotesingle{}$>$\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}\mbox{]}\textquotesingle{}. The user is expected to not use these symbols in words that are to be inserted to the trie. ~\newline
