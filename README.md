# Serialization & Deserialization of Trie

Serialization helps in the process of translating a data structure or object state into a format that can be stored (for example, in a file or memory data buffer) or transmitted (for example, across a computer network) and reconstructed later (possibly in a different computer environment).

Created a C++ library of Trie Data Structure which can do the following tasks:
1. Make a trie data structure with the help of a list of words or make an entirely empty trie.
2. Inserting all the words into the trie. 
3. Converting  the trie into a list of words.
4. Find out how many words in the trie that we made before have a given prefix
5. For all the words in the text file given , see if the word is present in the trie
6. Serialize the trie, that is,  to convert the trie to a string .
7. Finally ,Create a trie by making the use of a string representing the trie(Deserialization)

Note: Serialization of the trie to a string makes use of special characters '>' and ']'. The user is expected to not use these symbols in words that are to be inserted to the trie. <br>
